# challenge-3
In my third week of challenges this project helped me to sharpen my skills in being able to generate a password generator that would provide 
prompts to the users to confirm the requirements of the password gererator . Once the requirment is met successfully, the password created by 
the user will be generated . Being the first project that I used java script , there was some difficulty but with critical thinking I was
succesful in resolving the issues presented to me. for this project I used Html, Css and Js.
